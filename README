N-sample v0.1
Author: Michael D. Schneider

Code to add new large-scale Fourier mode realizations to an N-body simulation that 
was run without any large-scale power.

This version is not intended to readily compile on other systems, but matches the code version used 
for the publication below.

Dependencies (must be separately downloaded):

- FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/)
v2.1.5 is required for the MPI functionality.  For serial runs, FFTW v3.2.2 is also supported.
If the compiler flags -DFFTW and -DMPI are both omitted then the code will compile with 
FFT from the Sun Performance Library.  The routines in fft_nsample.f90 need to be changed 
for other FFT options in this case.

- FITPACK (http://www.netlib.org/fitpack/index.html)
Compile without the flag -DFITPACK to remove this dependency.  Log-linear interpolation of the 
theory power spectrum is used instead of splines in this case.
Interface blocks for the necessary FITPACK routines are included io_nsample.f90 in this package.

- read_millennium Routines by John Helly, ICC Durham.  These routines are not publicly available 
so the user of this software will need to replace the functionality for reading their own
N-body snapshot files.
